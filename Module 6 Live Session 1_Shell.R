## Practice on Data Visualization and Analysis

#This exercise will require ggplot2 and dplyr


#Read in Diamonds.csv data set as my_diamonds


#Attach my_diamonds


#Examine structure of my_diamonds


#Convert cut, color, and clarity to ordinal factors

#Get a statistical summary of carat (weight)


#Produce a histogram of carat using base R


#Produce a boxplot of carat using base R


#Check for missing values


#Filter out only diamonds that weigh between 0.75 and 1 carat and rename object 
#my_diamonds_sized


#Detach my_diamonds


#Attach my_diamonds



#Produce a Bar Chart in ggplot2 for count of diamonds by color


#Find average prices by color


#Find average prices by cut

#Find average prices by clarity

#Detach my_diamonds_sized

#Attach my_colors


#Produce a Bar Chart in ggplot2 for Average Price of Diamonds by Color


## Product a Facet Wrap Bar Chart for Average Price of Diamonds by Color 
## wrapped by Clarity

#Create a table for clarity I1


#Create a table for clarity SI2


#Create a table for clarity SI1


#Create a table for VS2


#Create a table for clarity VS1


#Create a table for clarity VVS2


#Create a table for clarity VVS1


#Create a table for clarity IF






#Combine rows of all tables by clarity


#Look at structure for my_colors_clar


#Convert clarity and colors to ordinal factors


#Detach my_colors


#Attach my_colors_clar



#Produce the facet wrap bar chart

 
#detach my_colors_clar


#Attach my_diamonds


#Examine correlation between carat and price


#Crop the data set to only include diamonds less than 2 carat


#Detach my_diamonds


#Attach my_diamonds_crop


#Produce a scatter plot for price (y) vs. carat (x)
#Also include linear regression line



#Develop a linear regression model for price (y) vs. carat (x) and store as lm_model


#Generate vectpr of predicted values and store as lm_predict


#Append predicted values on original data


#Find the predicted price for 1 carat diamond ring


#Plot residuals using ggplot2
